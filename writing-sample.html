     <h2 id="u214-3"><span id="u214">OVER 25 YEARS OF SERVICE </span> in the U.S. Navy trumps experiencing cancer—twice, according to Mr. Gary Lancaster. Diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of twelve, Lancaster also, more recently, conquered the battle of testicular cancer, previously survived a heart attack, and recovered from a broken back. His sole response to these misfortunes remains, “that’s why you tell people you love them every day” (G. Lancaster, personal communication April 16, 2015).</h2>
     <h2 id="u214-4">&nbsp;</h2>
     <h2 class="Paragraph">Diseases like cancer are often over-stigmatized and over-appreciated in light of other traumatic or otherwise life-changing experiences, especially active war duty, and thus, quite easily, patients of cancer consequently become pressured into one of two extreme categories of experience and expression after experience—Alan Young, Didier Fassin, and Richard Rechtman (as cited in Bell, 2012) describe these, stating, cancer works either in getting the survivor “‘stuck,’ and unable to progress” in life or, in providing an inspirational “kick-start” to positive life transformation (p. 590).</h2>
     <h2 class="Paragraph">&nbsp;</h2>
     <h2 class="Paragraph">Attention must also be brought to the unfortunate “personal link between disease and identity” drawn by society (Clarke, 2004, p. 541). American culture places cancer in a divided box of black and white, of progression and digression, of monumental separation—what Barbara Ehrenreich (as cited in Bell, 2012) categorizes, a “makeover opportunity” of remarkable proportions (p. 586). But perhaps, as in the life story of Gary Lancaster, cancer could be a simple point of stagnation. Of a fleeting memory which pales in comparison to other pivotal experiences, like war, in Lancaster’s instance.</h2>
     <h2 id="u214-10">&nbsp;</h2>
     <h2 class="Subheadings"><span class="Subheadings1">Stigma, Coping, &amp; Neutrality</span></h2>
     <h2 id="u214-13">&nbsp;</h2>
     <h2 class="Paragraph"><span id="u214-14">Scant research exists</span> on the experience of male breast cancer, especially in children—perhaps due the extremely low prevalence of breast cancer in men or, perhaps, due to many men’s attempt to cover up their stigmatized and feminized diagnosis. According to Tom Donovan and Dr. Maria Flynn, some participants in a study of male breast cancer “sought refuge from the struggle by concealing the diagnosis and initiating behavioral changes to limit public knowledge” (2007, p. 468).</h2>
     <h2 class="Paragraph">&nbsp;</h2>
     <h2 class="Paragraph">Gary Lancaster had a similar reaction to his being diagnosed with breast cancer, even as child. He admits to never having told any of his friends or schoolmates and, to this day, none of them know he ever had it. Even through his suppression, Lancaster’s emotional sensitivity to his memories of war remains detectable, a stark contrast to the evident lack of emotion when he discusses cancer.&nbsp; Regarding a war story of the corpse of a baby floating down “Shit River” in the Philippines in 1983, having been dumped by its mother, he expresses:</h2>
     <h2 class="Paragraph">&nbsp;</h2>
     <h2 class="Paragraph">It’s sad. It’s freakin’ sad. […] So it hardens you sometimes but that’s why I’m always smiling because you don’t wanna think about all the shit. You know? It masks the pain sometimes…but that was bad. That’s a memory I wish I didn’t have. Sorry. (personal communication, April 16, 2015)</h2>
     <h2 class="Subheadings">&nbsp;</h2>
     <h2 id="u214-26">Kirsten Bell (2012) highlights how some of the terms used by researchers and writers can “bring radically different groups, such as rape victims, cancer patients, war veterans, survivors of the Holocaust, and major natural disasters, into relation” (p. 592). She also tells how cancer can have a positive impact, as it potentially has “utility in transforming the cancer patient’s lifestyle” for the better (p. 589.)</h2>
     <h2 id="u214-27">&nbsp;</h2>
     <h2 id="u214-29">Similarly, war may have impacts of beneficial nature, as it often gets pointed to as the reason behind some personal life-transformations (disciplinary issues resolved, world views broadened, etc.) and increased status and reverence societally. However, both obviously also carry great potential for negative impact as well.</h2>
     <h2 id="u214-30">&nbsp;</h2>
     <h2 id="u214-32">On the other hand, cancer as an illness tends to be extremely stigmatized, (male breast especially, because of the de-masculinizing nature in society.)&nbsp; Tom Donovan and Dr. Maria Flynn (2007) claim, “there is little that men can do […] to escape the feminine associations that society attaches to a diagnosis of breast cancer” (p. 468). Donovan and Flynn quote one of their research participants, a male breast cancer survivor, who says, “some people think that a man with breast cancer cannot be a ‘real’ man. They think ‘he must be gay’ or ‘he is half-woman’” (p. 467).</h2>
     <h2 id="u214-33">&nbsp;</h2>
     <h2 id="u214-35">War brings stigmatization as well, as many people disagree with war entirely, and greet soldiers with sometimes cold and pitiless, harsh disapproval. Others approve of war but almost to the point of putting it and its participants on pedestals, which motivates them to welcome soldiers home with an expectation that their experience was powerfully traumatic and life-changing.</h2>
     <h2 id="u214-36">&nbsp;</h2>
     <h2 id="u214-38">The effects of war and cancer especially share characteristics and intermingle within someone who has experienced both. However, more research currently exists on post-military cancer diagnosis than on post-cancer military enlistment. Avron Spiro III and Richard A. Settersten Jr., in another example, also claim “combat exposure […] has the potential to impact coping [emphasis added] later in life” (2012, p. 186).</h2>
     <h2 id="u214-39">&nbsp;</h2>
     <h2 id="u214-41">One possibility not often acknowledged is that war or cancer, or both, may have a neutral impact. In fact, scholars almost always refer to cancer itself as some version of an “implacable enemy” fought only by the weapons in the “arsenal” of medicine; similarly, cancer “treatment is described as aggressive and ‘war-like,’ as ‘smart missiles,’” and “‘ways to disarm the disease’” (Clarke, 2006, 2597).</h2>
     <h2 id="u214-42">&nbsp;</h2>
     <h2 id="u214-44">Juanne N. Clarke writes multiple articles on the current image of cancer in society, but seems never to present anything but comparisons to war. These innumerable allusions continue to build on this idea that both war and cancer are terrible and traumatic, or else temporarily bad and eventually resulting in the other extreme of life improvement and benefit.</h2>
     <h2 id="u214-45">&nbsp;</h2>
     <h2 id="u214-47">Juanne Clarke cites articles by Armstrong and Jenkins, to exemplify verbiage used for the “the war against cancer,” in which patients must supposedly brave “the relentless attack” to “beat a deadly” disease (2012, p. 547). She even mentions, in an article by Armstrong and Sager, how Lance Armstrong referred to his own bout with cancer as “the toughest battle of [his] life” (p. 547).</h2>
     <h2 id="u214-48">&nbsp;</h2>
     <h2 id="u214-50">Though Gary Lancaster’s experience with war does in fact prove to be on the negative side, his cancer experience(s) quite prove the existence of this unspoken neutral-impact-zone of experience. He does mention at one point this war-like effect of cancer on life and its ability to eternally alter life. But, in his own experience, all he has to say looking back on his cancer is “that sucks, you know I could think of better things to have” (personal communication, April 16, 2015).</h2>
     <h2 id="u214-51">&nbsp;</h2>
     <h2 id="u214-53">Lancaster says of his thoughts as a child, “cancer kills, right? I mean that’s the thing I thought” (personal communication, April 16, 2015). The questioning he did as a child perfectly portrays the result of what this comparison to war can do in patients who have cancer. It also instills beliefs and passions which become expected of a survivor, which motivate that survivor to participate in and contribute to organizations such as the “Susan G. Coleman crap” Lancaster bluntly refers to (personal communication, April 16, 2015).</h2>
     <h2 id="u214-54">&nbsp;</h2>
     <h2 id="u214-56">Lancaster's final comment on his experience with cancer was the most revolutionary in its revealing of his truly unaffected, almost lackadaisical, attitude toward the cancer experience:</h2>
     <h2 id="u214-57">&nbsp;</h2>
     <h2 id="u214-59">“I mean I don’t know, it’s like life-changing, it’s for the rest of your life you know you’re different. Something’s different. You get to wear pink, a ribbon…[chuckles] wow” (personal communication, April 16, 2015).</h2>
     <h2 id="u214-60">&nbsp;</h2>
     <h2 id="u214-62">He also quotes a well-known phrase commonly enforced by his grandmother, one which accurately describes (at least the apparent) attitude he carries throughout life: “grin and bear it” (personal communication, April 16, 2015).</h2>
     <h2 id="u214-63">&nbsp;</h2>
     <h2 id="u214-67">The truth from a survivor: cancer isn’t always like war. Sometimes, cancer is just a sickness, just something to “grin and bear,” <span id="u214-65">just cancer</span>.</h2>
