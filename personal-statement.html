    <h2 class="Paragraph"><span class="Resume-text1">Breathe in, breathe out step one two three, breathe in, breathe out step one two three. I observe my patterned breathes steam in the freezing downpour ahead of me. Hitting the droplets with full force, I plow through them to reach the thing my eyes focus most clearly on—the white line. Everything else has begun to go quiet around me: crowd at right, teammates at left, coaches behind, but below I can hear the increasingly frequent and competitively aggressive scrapes of my metal spikes on the track.</span></h2>
    <h2 class="Paragraph">&nbsp;</h2>
    <h2 class="Paragraph"><span class="Resume-text1">Breathe in, breathe out step one two three, breathe in, breathe out step one two three. The repetitive techniques of sprinting remind me of the rhythm of writing. Though seemingly very different, my two most prioritized personal interests resemble each other both in style, and effect on my life. One similarity dwells in the importance of detail in each practice. Training, pacing, adjusting, each phase of the process—of both running and writing—requires tremendous attention to detail.</span></h2>
    <h2 class="Paragraph">&nbsp;</h2>
    <h2 class="Paragraph"><span class="Resume-text1">Just as my success as a runner depends on my analysis and arrangement of every step in a race, my potential as a writer relies greatly upon how much I care about the implications of every word in a piece, and how much I anticipate pondering the next one. I find myself typing and deleting the same word two or three times, before finally settling back onto the same word I chose in the first place. Because I have experienced the effects of attention to detail in training for a race, I can easily acknowledge the significance of equal effort (or compulsion) in writing. I have learned to embrace a certain obsessive-compulsive characteristic as a writer, and no longer feel guilty of being painstakingly fastidious with my preferences on the who, what, where, when, why, and how of my writing. I like for the pieces I write to be 100% authentic to me, which often means they contain multiple layers of meaning and complex thought. I put importance on the placement of every period and hope my efforts at controlling details work successfully at expanding my writing beyond the surface level—whether I am constructing a research report, or creating a piece of poetry. My inclination towards depth occurs not only when I write, but in running and even other areas of my life.</span></h2>
    <h2 class="Paragraph">&nbsp;</h2>
    <h2 class="Paragraph"><span class="Resume-text1">As I approach, I imagine the transformation of each digit on the stopwatch. With each passing fraction of the time, my heart beats faster; it anticipates the finish and hesitates at the thought of never racing again. So many elements of this sport represent the core beliefs central to my individual identity; each aspect remains relevant to a corresponding value outside of the sport—the strength, the endurance, the discipline. Red with the passions of motivation and commitment, my blood pumps down into my toes, where I can feel friction like the heat of a fire.</span></h2>
    <h2 class="Paragraph">&nbsp;</h2>
    <h2 class="Paragraph"><span class="Resume-text1">Much like competitive sprinting, successful writing depends heavily on both intentionality and passion. Both running and writing require preparation, practice, and performance—all components of a practical and (consciously) purposeful expression of passion. In the preparation phase of writing, I tend to gravitate towards anything of a stress-relieving and inspirational nature. Potential for inspiration, to me, lies in anything and everything, from the flow of rap music and saltiness of pickles to the sway of symphonies and bitterness of dark chocolate. I consider myself to be above nothing, in terms of inspiration, and I often find myself deeply affected by an enthusiastic appreciation for the smallest things in life. My preparation for writing is simple and consists of only one step: seek inspiration. Once I find something to provoke me into motivation, I can begin the next phase of the writing process.</span></h2>
    <h2 class="Paragraph">&nbsp;</h2>
    <h2 class="Paragraph"><span class="Resume-text1">Writing practice looks slightly different for me than the popular method of repetitive exercise and gradual progression, similar to the strength and conditioning approach common in training for track. For me, practice comes more in the form of repetitive performance and continuous improvement. Generally, I do not even subscribe to the regiment of draft-writing. First I receive a prompt, then I choose a thesis—on occasion, I skip this step and return back to it once the next is underway—and finally, I begin writing. I write until every thought is on the paper (or screen). Because writing serves as expression, I like to let each idea fall out of my head and float naturally onto whatever part of the piece feels right.</span></h2>
    <h2 class="Paragraph">&nbsp;</h2>
    <h2 class="Paragraph"><span class="Resume-text1">Personal philosophies often seem cliché and over-generalized to me but, nonetheless, I customarily apply an appreciation for all things “perfectly imperfect” in the world of writing. Because of this ideology, I liken the performance part of writing to an artistic session. I think, re-think, write, re-write and revise in no pre-determined order, all the while composing a sort of symphonic conglomeration of chaos. Somewhere, through this eccentrically spontaneous process of release and refinement, I (usually) find logic. Whether I am aware or not, the process always seems to have some sort of methodological rhythm by which I eventually stumble upon a beginning, middle, and ending, as well as an eventual completion of the piece—by completion I mean unsolidified and uncertified finalization, as I believe no piece of writing is ever fully disqualified from improvement and change. (Perhaps a piece of writing is “complete” only when the writer passes away, yet still then I feel one of the responsibilities of an audience is to interact with a work in some way, to collaborate, expand, or even debase a work—if the audience does so then the legacy, and therefore essence, of the piece lives on.) I love the idea of returning to an old work and re-working it into a new masterpiece, because I get the opportunity to re-define—to invent a new opportunity for performance.</span></h2>
    <h2 class="Paragraph">&nbsp;</h2>
    <h2 class="Paragraph"><span class="Resume-text1">Right foot, left foot, breathe. Breathe in, breathe out step one two three. Breathe in, breathe out and sprint through the finish. Every carb-less salad and every replay of baton hand-off film, every encouraging speech and every intimidating challenge, every cold morning in the weight room and every hot evening on the track, led up to this moment. I see the white blur beneath my shoes, and I stretch across the finish line with opponents at either side. I lose the race, but I also clock my fastest recorded time as of yet—a personal record for the 100 meter dash. Every second of preparation and practice was worth this minute of performance.</span></h2>
    <h2 class="Paragraph">&nbsp;</h2>
    <h2 class="Paragraph"><span class="Resume-text1">I find motivation in some extreme passion which sparks my nerves and ignites a remarkable drive in me. Both as a runner and a writer, I consider myself extremely self-motivated and consequentially self-disciplined. This determination connects the two faces of my identity. When I set in the blocks before a race, when I sit at the desk to write a paper, I feel an inexplicable surge of challenge and competitiveness. Both running and writing are intensely emotional to me—(rather, they can be; my eyes don’t swell with tears at the thought of composing a 15-page historical research paper on the unification of Texas.) I often feel a part of myself draw to each or both of them as if instinctively, even in phases when another part of me—the 19-year-old college Junior—feels little motivation to do so. This draw grows with the seriousness of a running event or the importance of a paper. Generally, I tend to be very passionate about many things in life, not just running and writing, because I find passion to be one of the most—if not the most—powerful forces in existence. In terms of running, my passion pushes me to compete to the best of my ability. But this passion often has great influence on aspects of my writing as well; it influences my methodology, style, content, and opinions (or lack, of any of the above). In both worlds, my passion fuels my determination. Because I love sprinting so much and appreciate the values beneath its practice, I will always finish a race. Because I so similarly adore writing and understand the value of it as anything from artistic expression to philosophical rhetoric, I will always complete a paper—though completion in writing might, first of all, take time and, second, become a matter of interpretation and opinion.</span></h2>
    <h2 class="Paragraph">&nbsp;</h2>
    <h2 class="Paragraph"><span class="Resume-text1">As far as future goals go, my retirement in competitive track has long been ongoing. (I do, of course, still love to run for fun and would, someday soon, like to coach.) However, as a writer, I plan on maintaining my identity forever, no matter what career(s) I find myself in. I will likely begin in the field of education, and then proceed to various other arenas of work, such as editing and publishing, magazine content, design, and layout, and possibly even anthropological fieldwork.&nbsp; I do not intend to waste time in any career of little fulfillment, and therefore will not settle. Though practicality is important to me, I plan on pursuing each of my writing passions to their end and, much like in a race, persisting until I reach the end—sprinting to the finish—where I find myself beyond the line of my ambition.</span></h2>
    <h2 class="Paragraph">&nbsp;</h2>
    <h2 class="Paragraph"><span class="Resume-text1">I don’t recall the first time I ever wrote, nor the first time I ever ran. But I do know my passion for each grows greater with age. In the case of running, I’ve begun to recognize some of the deeper places of motivation in me—beyond love for fitness, health, or physical activity as a pastime. My perspective of writing is developing over time as well, as I am starting to realize the breadth of impact writing potentially has on my personal life and the world around me. I see it as an effective form of both expression and discovery. It is successful at facilitating the sharing of personal desires and opinions, even when I (the writer) am unable to consciously sort through them and determine which are worth documenting or, much less, sharing. Writing also successfully allows both the writer and the reader to explore new realms of thought, and therefore inspires exploration and discovery of the unfamiliar. Be that unfamiliarity about me, the subject of my writing, or the world in general, it has the power to change the world—my writing has the power to change the world. One simple writing piece could spark an idea inside someone who starts a chain reaction of creativity and revolution, which eventually leads to the successful improvement of even just one detail of a society or culture. Speaking of writing in such an abstract way may seem mediocrely generic, but I truly believe in writing as a powerful weapon with the potential to impact the world. For this reason, I would characterize myself as more of an advocate for the discipline of writing, even before I would call myself a detail-oriented, passionate, and intentional writer.</span></h2>
